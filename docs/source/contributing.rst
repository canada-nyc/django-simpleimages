Contributing
============

If you find issues or would like to see a feature suppored, head over to
the `issues section:
<https://github.com/saulshanabrook/django-simpleimages/issues>`_ and report it.

To contribute code in any form, fork the `github repository:
<https://github.com/saulshanabrook/django-simpleimages>`_ and clone it locally.
Create a new branch for your feature::

    git commit -b feature/whatever-you-like

Add proper docstrings to any changed or added code.

Then make sure all the tests past (and write new ones for any new features).

With Docker
-------------------------
You must have Docker_ and `Docker Compose`_ installed.

To run the tests::

    docker-compose up

To build the docs::

    docker-compose run --no-deps python make docs-html
    open docs/build/index.html


Without Docker
-------------------------
To run the tests you must be running PostgreSQL with a database
called ``django_simpleimages_test``. To create one run::

    createuser -s postgres
    psql -c 'create database postgres;' -U postgres

Then install Python dependencies::

    pip install -e .
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt


And finally run the tests::

    py.test

To test for RQ support, you must have a Redis installed and accesible
via default login. If py.test can't find a working Redis connection,
it will skip the RQ tests.

Check if the ``README.rst`` looks right::

    restview --long-description

Compile the documentation and check if it looks right::

    make docs-html
    open docs/build/index.html

Then push the finished feature to github and open a pull request form the branch.

New Release
-----------
To create a new release:

1. Add changes to ``docs/source/changelog.rst``, using Releases_ formatting
2. Change version in ``setup.py``
3. Change version in ``docs/source/conf.py``
4. ``python setup.py sdist upload``
5. ``python setup.py bdist_wheel``
6. ``git tag x.x.x``
7. Push git tag and commit
8. Add release to github tag, with changes and releasion name.
